                        Higher management, who were generally older individuals, were not

                        There were essentially two design choices, both linked to 
                        the two languages the scripts were written in:

                        An excel addin did not require administrator access; 
                        Visual Basic (VB) scripts could be integrated more easily 
                        and <ContentText color={inpcolor}>equipping the tool for different teams would not require separate development</ContentText>.

                        Team-specific tools could be uploaded easily by pushing 
                        the code into the addin so that a <ContentText color={inpcolor}>different user

                        A pilot test was done with the North America Oil 
                        and Gas Team, and the <ContentText color={inpcolor}>team responded well to the

                    On initial testing of the interface, team members reported 
                    a drop of twenty percent in the number of hours spent per 
                    task per person. Shortly after, a second version was pushed 
                    that was equipped to three teams and their twenty workstations.
